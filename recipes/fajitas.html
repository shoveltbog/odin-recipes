        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h4>For the Fajitas</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 kilogram of chicken thigh or skirt steak</li>
                <li>1 onion slice thinly</li>
                <li>2 capsicum, assorted colours, thinly sliced </li>
                <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
                <li>canola oil spray</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>2 limes, quartered</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>For the Marinade</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Zest & juice of 1 orange</li>
                <li>Zest & juice of 2 limes</li>
                <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 jalapeño, minced</li>
                <li>1/2 bunch cilantro</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt & pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of cumin</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together all the ingredients for the marinade in a large bowl. Add the steak and toss until coated. Set aside for 40 minutes, or longer if you have the time.</li>
            <li>Heat a grill, grill pan, or iron skillet over high heat. Remove the meat from the marinade and wipe off excess liquid. Spray the cooking surface with a little bit of oil. Set in the meat and cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the steak. It should be medium-rare but have a good sear on it. Remove the steak and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Spray the pan with a little more oil and then the vegetables. Add them in batches if they can't all fit in one layer. Cook for a minute or two per side, or until they have little blotches of black but are still crisp. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Thinly slice the meat across the grain. Toss it into a bowl with the peppers. Serve with warmed corn tortillas, lime wedges, and salt to taste.</li>
        </ol>
