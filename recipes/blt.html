            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p class="info">A BLT is a classic sandwich made with crispy bacon, fresh lettuce, and juicy tomatoes. It's a simple yet incredibly satisfying combination of flavors. The crispy bacon adds a salty and smoky element, while the lettuce and tomatoes provide a refreshing crunch and natural sweetness.</p> 
                <p class="info">The ingredients are typically sandwiched between toasted bread slices and can be enhanced with mayonnaise or other condiments for added creaminess.</p> 

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
